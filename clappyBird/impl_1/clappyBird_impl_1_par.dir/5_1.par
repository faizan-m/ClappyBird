Start NBR router at 15:29:19 04/27/19

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in timing report. You should always run the timing    
      tool to verify your design.

Starting routing resource preassignment
WARNING - par: Certain loads of primary clock signal clk could not be routed to the primary clock tree with dedicated routing resources. This clock may suffer from excessive skew or delay.
WARNING - par: The driver of primary clock signal game_state_inst/forty_eight_mhz_counter[19] is placed in a location (R13C5C.Q0) that cannot drive the primary clock tree with dedicated routing resources. Some general routing resources may be used and this clock may suffer from excessive skew or delay.
